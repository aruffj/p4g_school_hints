[f 0 5 -258][f 2 1]Hello, everyone. My name is Kimiko Sofue,[n]and I don't know how much you know about[n]world history, but I'm an expert.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 -258][f 2 1]First, a little about me. I love to use[n]my dowser to look for lost items, and[n]there's nothing quite like a romance.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 -258][f 2 1]In fact, world history is a magnificent[n]romance. History is like a river, it was[n]born in the past and flows ever forward.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 -258][f 2 1][f 4 9 900 3 5 0 5]I hope we can all enjoy the profundity[n]of history together. Hohoho.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 -258][f 2 1]And since this is my first lecture,[n]I'll start with an easy question.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 -258][f 2 1]Our transferee, Mr. [f 4 1], please[n]stand up.[n][f 1 1][e]

[msg MES_133 [Ms. Sofue]]
[f 0 5 -258][f 2 1]The western calendar is based on[n]Anno Domini, the traditionally believed[n]year of Jesus Christ's birth.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 -258][f 2 1]The years before this are referred[n]to as "Before Christ"; a label which is[n]similarly abbreviated.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 -258][f 2 1]What is the year before 1 AD called?[n][f 1 1][e]

[f 0 5 -258][f 2 1]Ah, you seem to understand this well.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 -258][f 2 1][f 4 9 900 3 5 0 5]If you think that history is like math, [n]0 AD would be the natural assumption,[n]but world history is much more complicated.[n][f 1 1][e]

[f 0 5 -258][f 2 1]That's why, when counting backwards,[n]we go from 1 AD straight to 1 BC.[n][f 1 1][e]
