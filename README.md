# What is this?

This is a comprehensive text patch for the PC Version of Persona 4 Golden which is aimed to allow new players to get the answers in school questions right by deduction rather then needing to use an external guide or the also available cheat mod.

It is aimed to keep the original spirit alive so I've tried to add lines where possible but some  original texts were modified to bridge logic holes. 

This mod was a suggestion by the excellent mod creator [rudiger_gb](https://gamebanana.com/members/1491857)! Make sure to check out his work. Thanks again for the introduction!

## V.01 Changes:
- Changed/Added lines to the following date school questions. Dates are referencing the games format.

April:
	* 4/14 - Accordingly, the years are counted backwards before. Also they weren't shortened to AD.
	* 4/18 - Interestingly enough the name comes from the first two Greek letters alpha and beta.
	* 4/20 - **LINE CHANGED TO:** Now, then... Lets talk about Marukami's three part series "The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle". - Hana-Chan! I'm calling on you! Were you even listening? How many parts does the book series have?
	* 4/25 - Hahaha! Don't look so sad! Everything requires muscles, after all! We will make your muscles overcompensate!
	* 4/26 - It's even common that marriages break up because of money issues. Luckily there aren't any "marriage numbers" in math.
	* 4/30 - Parents get angry so easily. They might think about something extreme! Maybe they'd push me in a canyon like the Valles Marineris. - Ahem, anyway, that's an interesting topic for today! Close your books and take a look at the handout. 

May:
	* 5/7 - Soseki once translated the phrase "I love you" into a rather poethic phrase, referencing lunar beauty. - He felt that he could preserve the subtle sinsibility of the Meiji's period Japanese language. 

June:
	* 6/8 - **ANSWER CHANGED**: "Uneven Bars." to "Bech Presses." (Less correlation to balancing)
	* 6/13 - To do so it needs to break down glucose without oxygen! The Greek name for that is anaerobic!
	* 6/15 - **LINE CHANGED TO:**Morals are about virtue! A groups morale is... Tell me, Hanamura! You seem to be lacking in morals!
	* 6/27 - **LINE CHANGED TO:** This class seems to be full of students without their own individual identities! - Isn't that right? ...Why the hell do you all look so upset!? Stand your ass up, [MC]!
	* 6/30 - **ANSWER CHANGED**: "Lame Duck River." to "Uphill River." (Unlogic Name; Unsure about that edit.)

July:
	* 7/13 - But beware of the Sphenopalatine ganglioneuralgia! Hahaha!- Your confused expressions tell me that you've never heard that! It's the medical term for brainfreeze!
	* 7/15 - This line also marks the middle of the Earth, splitting it in two equally divided parts.
	* 7/16 - It seems that he was a good looking fellow. Especially that smooth skin in his face...

## ToDo:
* September to January Texts
* Gameplay testing
