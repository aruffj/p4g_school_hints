# What is this?

This is a comprehensive text patch for the PC Version of Persona 4 Golden which is aimed to allow new players to get the answers in school questions right by deduction rather then needing to use an external guide or the also available cheat mod.

It is aimed to keep the original spirit alive so I've tried to add lines where possible but some  original texts were modified to bridge logic holes. 

This mod was a suggestion by the excellent mod creator [rudiger_gb](https://gamebanana.com/members/1491857)! Make sure to check out his work. Thanks again for the intro into the tools and even more for proofreading. :)
